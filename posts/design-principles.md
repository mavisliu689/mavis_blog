## Less, but Better

Dieter Rams said it best. Every element on screen should earn its place. If it doesn't serve the user, it's noise.

## Consistency Over Cleverness

Clever interactions can delight, but consistency builds trust. Users should always know where they are and what to expect.

## Typography is Design

Good typography alone can make a design feel polished. Pay attention to:

- Line height (1.6–1.8 for body text)
- Font size hierarchy
- Whitespace and rhythm
- Contrast ratios for readability

## Design for the Edge Cases

The happy path is easy. Great design handles errors gracefully, supports accessibility, and works on slow connections.

## Ship, Then Iterate

Perfectionism kills progress. Ship something good, learn from real usage, and improve incrementally.
