## Why Build a Blog?

In an era of social media, having your own space on the internet feels increasingly important. A personal blog is a place to think deeply, share ideas, and own your content.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with a simple but powerful stack:

- **Next.js** — React framework with static export
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Markdown** — Content authoring with frontmatter
- **GitHub Pages** — Free, reliable hosting

## What I Learned

The process of building this taught me a lot about static site generation, CSS transitions, and the importance of good typography. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective.

## What's Next

I plan to add search functionality, RSS feeds, and perhaps a newsletter integration. But for now, I'm happy with a clean, fast, and minimal setup.
